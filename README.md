# Stryxshell

Shell made with ncurses :)

This project is made only for testing purposes. Security is not a priority since I'm mainly focused on setting up some terminal configurations 
and testing builtins, commands, normal shell procedures and other stuff. 

Im testing only on my main computer, so it may not work properly over there. 

#### SOME FIXES NEED TO BE MADE REGARDING THE SCREEN AND NCURSES.
#### I don't know if anyone in the field would use this on production. DON'T DO IT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.

Checkout for more stuff on my github profile. I plan on posting more about Malware developing and Analysis, reverse engineering, assembly and other on the future =)
