# Stryxshell

Shell made with ncurses :)
USE FULLSCREEN BEFORE RESIZING IS FIXED.

This project is made only for testing purposes. Security is not a priority since I'm mainly focused on setting up some terminal configurations 
and testing builtins, commands, normal shell procedures and other stuff. 
As I'm developing this piece of software, I research specific topics to advance on my cybersecurity studies, software security and reverse engineering.

Im testing only on my main computer, so it may not work properly over there. 

#### SOME FIXES NEED TO BE MADE REGARDING THE SCREEN AND NCURSES.
#### DEBUGGING FOR LEAKED MEMORY IS GOING TO BE FIXED IN THE FUTURE.
#### I don't know if anyone in the field would use this on production. DON'T DO IT FOR OBVIOUS REASONS.


Checkout for more stuff on my github profile. I plan on posting more about Malware developing and Analysis, reverse engineering, assembly and other on the future =)
